Release 1.99

-HVRGrabbable - removed scale warning for now.
-HVRGlobal prefab updated with required components, including SFXPlayer, updated main examples scenes to use it (not integration packages).

-HVRSocket 
	- set grabbable local offsets a frame after when using RemoveRigidbody socketing as the rigidbody might move one more time this cycle.
	- 'RemoveRigidbody' mode no longer requires the socket to have a rigidbody

-HVRPosableGrabPoint 
	-JointOffset Renamed to HandRotationOffset. This rotation offset will no longer be applied to the hand to object joint, but will instead offset		
		the controller tracking target when this grab point is held. Existing users of this field will probably need to adjust their offsets.
	-Added HandPositionOffset - positional offset to apply to the controller tracking when held.
	
-HVRHandgrabber - added ControllerOffset field (HVRControllerOffset), auto populated from the 'TrackedController' field if that is populated.
-HVRControllerOffset 
	- updated to manage the additional offsets provided by grab points.
	- Added SetMiscPositionOffset(position, rotation) method which will let you further offset the controller tracking at runtime if desired.


Release 1.98

-Fixed "full" log spam when releasing objects
-Fixed an issue where grabbable rigidbody collision detection mode would not revert to pre grab state if the object was grabbed within 10 seconds of release
-Fixed an issue where HVRPlayerController - MovementEnabled set to false would prevent gravity from taking affect.

-HVRTimeManager will no longer set all rigidbodies in the scene to interpolate when time step smoothing is disabled.
-HVRGrabbable Rigidbody property is made public
-HVRStabber - added ForceUnstab method.
-HVRStabber - added 'IgnoreVelocityCheck' field. If true will ignore stabbable velocity requirement for stab entry.
-HVRPlayerController - CameraRig XZ now offset by the initial HMD position on start to keep the player in it's intended position
-HVRPlayerController - Climbing movement is now clamped to max distance of either left or right hand when two handed climbing.

-HVRSocketContainer - virtualized methods
-HVRHandAnimator - added FingerCurlsSource public property to set the source of finger tracking values. Useful for users wanting to sync in multiplayer.
-HVRGrabbable - logs warning on awake when the object is not of 1,1,1 scale which is required for the grab system to work correctly.

Release 1.97

-Fixed Hand Pose Editor from resetting hand poses on object selection due to a change Unity made to their object field change events in 2020+ 
-Fixed an issue where grabbing a rigidbody with rotation constraints enabled would cause a inertia tensor 0 error on second release of the object.

-HVRHandGrabber GrabTrigger now supports "Manual Release" in addition to Active and Toggle holds. The held object will not be dropped until	
	the ForceRelease method is called on the grabbable or the hand component.
-HVRHandGrabber - IK auto pose can now grab static grabbables without a rigidbody.
-HVRSocketBag now has "IgnoreSockets" list and IgnoreSocket(HVRSocket) method to ignore specific sockets (useful to ignore sockets on the hand / wrist area)
-HVRHandGrabOnStart - new component to force a hand grabber to grab a specific grabbable after start.
-HVRSocketable - added LinkedGrabbables for compound objects, if any linked grabbable is being held, the object cannot be socketed.
-Bow prefab updated with an additional grab point with the hand in 180 degrees opposite orientation
-HVRGrabbable - Added HandFullReleased event which executes when a hand released it and it is no longer being held after.
-HVRGrabbable - Added DisableHandCollision field to HVRGrabbable, if true the hand holding this object will have it's collision disabled while held.

Release 1.96

-Fixed VRIK Tutorial Link
-Fixed OpenXR controller detection for old WMR devices
-Fixed XRPluginManagement compile error in HVRInputManager when using XRPlugin version < 4
-Fixed an issue with the physics bow shooting direction because it shoots in the next frame after destroying the arrow joint.
-Fixed linked sockets from playing their grabbed SFX
-Fixed an issue where having multiple inspectors open with HVRPosableHand would cause the selected pose to pose the hand.
-HVRPosableHand : added "Preview Selected" button (with undo support) which will pose the hand with the pose in the Selected Pose field. 
	The hand will no longer immediately pose on Selected Pose field changed to prevent accidently ruining
	hand posing if the user clicks on the hand preview when multiple inspectors are open.
-Added OpenXR controller detection for hp reverb g2
-Reduced default collision ignore on grabbable release from 5s to .5s

Concave Collider Grabbable:
	-Grab Detection ignores max distance check
	-Auto pose will ray cast from palm forward, if nothing is hit then the palm position is used so the grab won't fail
	-HVRHandGrabber will not use line of sight checks


Release 1.95
Fixes:
-Fixed HVRTriggerGrabbableBag not removing grabbables when using HVRSettings(UseAttachedRigidBody / ComponentInParentFallback)
-sockets whose objects aren't allowed to be removed by the hand will no longer cause another socket to be unhovered 
	(example: holstered pistol with a mag socket holding a magazine)
-Fixed editor build error introduced in 1.94 in HVRSettings
-Fixed an issue where grabs might not execute when update and fixed update are out of sync

Grab Detection Updates:
-Grab Input Checks moved to Update
-Line of sight checks that might fail because the ray origin is inside a collider will try and detect this case and return true
-Added support for non convex meshes in the grab detection system (could be useful for climbing the environment)
-HVRGrabbable : Add 'UseColliderClosestPoint' (Default true), used by line of sight and grabbable detection distance check
-Line of sight check updated to ray cast at the collider closest point instead of collider bounds if grabbable
	 doesn't have concave colliders. Concave colliders will aim at the collider bound center.
	 Should help with distance grabbing objects with larger colliders.
-HVRGrabbable : Added 'GrabColliders', if populated only these colliders will be used to detect a grab.

HVRCollisionEvents : Added ImpulseOrVelocity option that triggers the threshold met event.
HVRHandAnimator : now updates poses in LateUpdate instead of Update
HVRHandGrabber : updates physics pose in LateUpdate
HVRRayCastGun : added 'Hit' event
HVRCameraRig : organized the inspector fields and added tooltips, set CameraYOffset default to 0

The bow is finally here!
HVRBowBase : base class for common bow functionality
HVRPhysicsBow : physics based bow setup 

Interactable Additions: 
HVRPhysicsDial - create objects that rotate about an axis with optional rotation limits.
HVRPhysicsButton - easily create buttons along an axis with joints setup for you 
HVRPhysicsDoor - create physics doors that optionally require a door handle to be rotated to open
HVRPhysicsDrawer - easily create drawers that are joint limited based on start / end position
HVRRotationTracker - used to generically track rotation differences on an axis of rotation.
HVRRotationLimiter - used to limit rotations beyond 180 degrees.
HVRPhysicsLever - subclass of HVRPhysicsDial, no additional fields as of yet.
HVRPhysicsLeverCreator - component that will create a lever for you adding the necessary components.
